# [Unofficial] Community Implementation of StyleAvatar3D

As the original authors for StyleAvatar3D were unable to publish their code, I decided to work on my own reimplementation of their paper. Star and tag along and if you'd like to help out, let me know! I've only just started so if you're seeing this, come back in two weeks hopefully there's more completed :)

The original paper: [StyleAvatar3D: Leveraging Image-Text Diffusion Models for High-Fidelity 3D Avatar Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19012)

## TODO
**Core Features**
| Feature | Percentage Completed |

| Pose generation for depth maps (used for control net + dataset generation) | [75%] |
| EG3D port | [0%] |
| Stable diffusion integration | [0%] |
| Controlnet integration | [0%] |
| Training loop | [0%] | 
| Testing loop | [0%] |

**Future Features**
1. Training and testing GUI
2. Mixamo-compatible full-body avatars
