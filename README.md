# Community Implementation of StyleAvatar3D

As the original authors for StyleAvatar3D were unable to publish their code, I decided to work on my own reimplementation of their paper. Star this repo and tag along and if you'd like to help out, let me know! I've only just started so if you're seeing this, come back in two weeks hopefully, there's more completed :)

The original paper: [StyleAvatar3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19012)

## Updates
- The [original authors](https://github.com/icoz69/StyleAvatar3D) have recently announced they will be releasing their code. I will still continue on my implementation, as I plan on adding additional tooling for everyday use, and not just replicating research.

## TODO
